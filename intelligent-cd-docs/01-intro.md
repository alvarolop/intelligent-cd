## Introduction

This document outlines the deployment strategy and recommendations for the **Intelligent CD** Python-based application on OpenShift. The goal is to provide a standardized approach that ensures the application is deployed in a secure, stable, and scalable manner. These guidelines are based on OpenShift and cloud-native best practices.

The complete deployment guide is split into several focused documents for easier navigation and reference:

- **01-intro.md** - Introduction and overview (this document)
- **02-deployment-constraints.md** - Security, resource allocation, and statelessness requirements
- **03-network-security.md** - Network policies, firewall rules, and security configurations
- **04-routing-loadbalancing.md** - Route configuration and load balancer setup
- **05-storage-architecture.md** - Storage requirements and architectural considerations
- **06-resource-monitoring.md** - Resource management and monitoring setup
- **07-deployment-procedures.md** - Deployment workflows and troubleshooting
- **08-compliance-contacts.md** - Compliance requirements and contact information

## Application Overview

- **Application Name:** Intelligent CD (Intelligent Continuous Deployment)
- **Version:** 2.1.4
- **Technology Stack:** Python 3.11+, FastAPI, PostgreSQL 15, Redis 7.2
- **Deployment Target:** OpenShift 4.14+ clusters
- **Expected Load:** 1000-5000 requests/minute
- **Data Classification:** Internal Use Only (IUO)

### Application Purpose

The Intelligent CD application is a continuous deployment platform that automates the deployment of applications across multiple OpenShift clusters. It provides intelligent decision-making capabilities for deployment strategies, rollback procedures, and canary deployments.

### Key Features

- **Multi-cluster Deployment:** Support for deploying across development, staging, and production clusters
- **Intelligent Rollbacks:** Automatic rollback detection based on metrics and health checks
- **Canary Deployments:** Gradual rollout with automatic traffic shifting
- **Deployment Analytics:** Historical deployment data and success rate analysis
- **Integration Support:** Webhook support for CI/CD pipeline integration
