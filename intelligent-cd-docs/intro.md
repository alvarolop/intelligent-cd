## Deployment Recommendations and Constraints

Following these recommendations will help ensure the application runs smoothly within the OpenShift environment and adheres to standard security and operational practices.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Security Context Constraints (SCC)

Your application must **not** require special Security Context Constraints (SCCs). The deployment should be able to run with the default `restricted` SCC. This means the application must:

- **Not run as the root user** - Must use UID 1000 or higher
- **Not require privileged access** - No CAP_SYS_ADMIN or similar capabilities
- **Not mount host paths** - Use persistent volumes instead
- **Not use host networking** - Use service networking only
- **Not require host IPC or PID namespaces**

**Approval Process for SCC Changes:**
1. Submit request to security@company.com
2. Include business justification and risk assessment
3. Security team review (2-3 business days)
4. Architecture team approval (1-2 business days)
5. Final approval from CISO office (1 business day)

**Contact for SCC Exceptions:** security@company.com with subject "SCC Exception Request - [Application Name]"

### üß† Resource Allocation (CPU and Memory)

Properly sizing your application is crucial for performance and cost management. You must define **resource requests and limits** for CPU and memory in your deployment configuration.

#### Resource Requirements by Environment

| Environment | CPU Request | CPU Limit | Memory Request | Memory Limit | Replicas |
|-------------|-------------|-----------|----------------|--------------|----------|
| **Development** | 100m | 200m | 128Mi | 256Mi | 1-2 |
| **Staging** | 250m | 500m | 256Mi | 512Mi | 2-3 |
| **Production** | 500m | 1000m | 512Mi | 1Gi | 3-5 |

#### Resource Configuration Example

```yaml
resources:
  requests:
    cpu: "500m"
    memory: "512Mi"
  limits:
    cpu: "1000m"
    memory: "1Gi"
```

**Resource Management Best Practices:**
- Set limits to 2x requests for CPU and 1.5x for memory
- Monitor resource usage with Prometheus/Grafana
- Use Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) for production workloads
- Contact database@company.com for database resource sizing

**Resource Scaling Approval:**
- **Development/Staging:** DevOps team (devops@company.com)
- **Production:** Architecture team (architecture@company.com) + CTO approval

### üîÑ Statelessness

The application must be **stateless**. This means that it should not store any session data, temporary files, or other state on its local filesystem. This is a critical requirement for a cloud-native environment.

#### Stateful Components

| Component | Storage Type | Contact | Approval Required |
|-----------|--------------|---------|-------------------|
| **User Sessions** | Redis Cluster | database@company.com | Yes - Architecture |
| **File Uploads** | S3-Compatible Storage | storage@company.com | Yes - Storage Team |
| **Application Logs** | Centralized Logging | logging@company.com | No - Standard |
| **Configuration** | ConfigMaps/Secrets | platform-engineering@company.com | No - Standard |

**Stateful Requirements Process:**
1. Submit request to architecture@company.com
2. Include storage requirements and data lifecycle
3. Architecture review (3-5 business days)
4. Storage team assessment (2-3 business days)
5. Security review for data classification (2-3 business days)

### ü™µ Logging

Your application should **write all logs to standard output (stdout) and standard error (stderr)**. OpenShift's logging system automatically collects logs from these streams.

#### Logging Standards

| Log Level | Output Stream | Retention | Contact |
|------------|---------------|-----------|---------|
| **ERROR** | stderr | 90 days | logging@company.com |
| **WARN** | stdout | 30 days | logging@company.com |
| **INFO** | stdout | 7 days | logging@company.com |
| **DEBUG** | stdout | 3 days | logging@company.com |

**Logging Configuration:**
```python
import logging
import sys

# Configure logging to stdout/stderr
logging.basicConfig(
    level=logging.INFO,
    format='%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s',
    handlers=[
        logging.StreamHandler(sys.stdout),
        logging.StreamHandler(sys.stderr)
    ]
)
```

**Logging Issues Contact:** logging@company.com or oncall-platform@company.com (urgent)

### üåê Port Configuration

Your application should be configured to listen on port **8080**. OpenShift automatically handles routing traffic to this port.

#### Port Configuration by Service Type

| Service Type | Port | Protocol | Contact |
|--------------|------|----------|---------|
| **HTTP API** | 8080 | TCP | networking@company.com |
| **Health Check** | 8080 | TCP | platform-engineering@company.com |
| **Metrics** | 8080 | TCP | monitoring@company.com |
| **Admin Interface** | 8080 | TCP | security@company.com |

**Port Change Process:**
1. Submit request to networking@company.com
2. Include business justification and impact assessment
3. Network team review (1-2 business days)
4. Security review if non-standard port (1 business day)

### üê≥ Container Image

The application must be built into a **container image**. Use a multi-stage Dockerfile to create a small, efficient, and secure image.

#### Image Requirements

| Requirement | Specification | Contact |
|-------------|---------------|---------|
| **Base Image** | Red Hat UBI 9 minimal | security@company.com |
| **Size Limit** | < 200MB | devops@company.com |
| **Security Scan** | Passes Trivy/Clair | security@company.com |
| **Registry** | company-registry.company.com | devops@company.com |

**Image Build Process:**
1. Submit Dockerfile to devops@company.com for review
2. Security scan approval from security@company.com
3. Build and push to registry by DevOps team
4. Image signing and verification
